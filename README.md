# CS188-Projects Details

  1. **Project Description (Outcomes)**: In this project, your Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. You will build general search algorithms and apply them to Pacman scenarios.
  2. **Main Algorithms Applied**: Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, Uniform - Cost Graph Search, A* Search, Consistent Heuristic, Manhattan Distance, Greedy Search
  3. **Application of Algorithms**:
     * **3.1 DFS**: Using the DFS algorithm to help Pacman plan its route.
     * **3.2 BFS**: Planning Pacman's route of travel.
     * **3.3 Uniform - Cost Graph Search**: Building on the route planning for Pacman to find the optimal route.
     * **3.4 A* Search and Manhattan Distance**: More efficiently planning the optimal routes for Pacman to meet various requirements compared to Uniform - Cost Graph Search (e.g., Corner problem).
     * **3.5 A* Search and Consistent Heuristic**: Used for planning and finding the best route for Pacman.
     * **3.6 Greedy Search**: Planning Pacman's route of travel.
